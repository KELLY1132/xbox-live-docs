# Development tools for Xbox Live

Various tools in `XboxLiveTools.zip` can help you develop for Xbox Live.

To get these Xbox Live development tools, you can download `XboxLiveTools.zip` using this [aka.ms link](https://aka.ms/xboxliveuwptools).

> [!NOTE]
> `XboxLiveTools.zip` includes the MatchSim tool, but that tool can only be used by Managed Partners, not by Creators Program developers.

Many of these tools are also available in the [Xbox Live Developer Tools GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-developer-tools) repo.

To create your own custom tooling, you can use the [Dev Tools library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Xbox.Services.DevTools).
