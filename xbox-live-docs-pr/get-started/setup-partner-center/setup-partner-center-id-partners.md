To add Xbox Live functionality to your game, start by setting up a game in Partner Center, by following the steps below.


## Prerequisites

* Have a prototype of your game, such as a demo and screen captures.

* [Joining the ID@Xbox Program](../join-dev-program/join-id-program.md).

Next, at Partner Center, create a new game, as follows.

1. Go to <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">Partner Center</a>.
