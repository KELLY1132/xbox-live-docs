# Relying parties

A web service needs to be configured as a relying party of Xbox live in order to provide the Single Sign-On experience to Xbox Live users.
Users who are authenticated to Xbox Live will be automatically authenticated to the web service without having to re-enter a different set of credentials.

See the section [Configure Relying Party](../web-services/live-web-services.md#configure-relying-party) in the article "Setting up Web Services at Partner Center".
